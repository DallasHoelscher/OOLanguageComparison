## OO Language Comparison

* Pick two object-oriented languages.
* Form a team to work on the comparison.
  * You can be a team of 1.
  * Teams greater than 4 are usually not a good idea.
* Using the comparison criteria provided, compare the two languages
through documentation and code examples.
* The documentation is to be written in markdown.
* The documentation and code examples are to be in a
GitHub public repository that the team uses.
* The **home page** is to be the README.md for the repository.
* Other mark down pages can be linked using relative links in markdown files.
[Relative links in markdown files](https://github.com/blog/1395-relative-links-in-markup-files).
* The README.md is to include near the top:
    * The two languages being compared.
    * The names of the members of the team.
* The URL for the GitHub repository for your team is to be submitted via an assignment on Canvas.
